This application could be useful for users who are on vacation and want to edit photographs in a fun way and then share with their friends.

Functionality
The application uses photographs that can be uploaded from the photo gallery or can be taken at that very moment, these photographs can be edited with lines of different colors and points, text can be added and finally after being edited they can be shared with others users through WhatsApp, email, Telegram, etc.

Logic flow
To use this application it is recommended to follow these steps.

1. Capture the photo (from the camera or from the "Load photo" photo gallery).
2. Edit the photo with your finger, for which it is possible to use lines (click on random line to choose a random line color) and points
3. Add text to the photo through the text box and the "Add text to photo" button
4. Share the edited photograph with other users through the "Share" button
